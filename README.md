# COMP 3133 – Lab Test – 2 :student:
# SpaceX Missions

The project was developed using TypeScript and Angular, and it retrieves data from the SpaceX API to display all the missions on the main screen. When a user clicks on a mission, a dialog window pops up to provide more details about the mission. Additionally, the project allows users to filter the missions by year.
